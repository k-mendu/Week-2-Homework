Week 2 Homework
#Summarize todayâ€™s results and how do they compare to the assembly results in the paper they came from?
Today's results were not as good as the paper, as only 18.6% of the analysis was complete. This was very much under the results from the paper. 


Is the assembly built today a good assembly?
No, as it is was very incomplete. 

What are some additional tools we could use and what might they tell us?
We can use a different technique such as Canu during the assembly stage. We could also use a different type of sequencing than Pac Bio. 

Try running the same pipeline on a bacterial genome with the GenAssem2_slurm.sh (in /projects/e32771/Scripts/02.Assembly). How does this output compare to the fungal assembly?
The assembly was much more complete and well-assembled.
